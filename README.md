# Thank-You-Note Generator for the Carpentry@UiO Community

This is my gift to the awesome instructors, helpers, and the library staff that make the Carpentry@UiO community what it is!

## How To…?

Click on the link (https://arockenberger.github.io/thankyou/), and you will land on a website. Here, click on the big red button "Thank You!", sit back and feel good about yourself!

## About

This repository contains the following three files that are important to run the scripts:

* [index.html](index.html)
  * *HTML-code, containing style information*
* [javascript.js](javascript.js)
  * *Javascript file containing the quotes from the sticky notes and a script for generating quotes randomly.The script also contains style information.*
* [yellow-sticky_800px.png](yellow-sticky_800px.png)
  * *Image file of a sticky note, serves as a background image.*

The other files in the repository are not necessary for functionality, but might be useful for testing and as a source for alternative images etc.

**TO-DO**

* The style information in the HTML-header and in the Javascript function should be transferred to a CSS file style.css
* The quotes in (javascript.js) should be transferred to a text file and the Javascript file should be modified accordingly. The idea is to continuously add the positive sticky note feedback to a quotes.txt file from which the Javascript fetches the contents
* Overall design of the final product: I am not a designer, but I would like this ThankYou! to become as visually pleasing as possible. Feel free to come up with a dashing design!

**Acknowledgements**

* I basically used every help I could get with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I made extensive use of the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) explanations and examples and shamelessly copied and edited examples I found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) by googling hard and made them fit my needs. I owe thanks to (@jaknil) for helping me debugging the Javascript (turns out you cannot have quotation marks within quotation marks…) and encouraging me to finish the project. The running versions of the [HTML](index.html) and the [Javascript](javascript.js) were finished at [BitRaf](https://bitraf.no/) on Dec 7, 2019.
